## **Simple Game Engine**

### This is not realy a game engine. It's more like the ground work for my friend or other people to start developing simple games.

#### It includes the ability to draw from multiple classes, a KeyListener, MouseListener and much more that I'm constantly implementing!

> [!NOTE]
> The folder resources is ment for the development of games and does not contain any vital files.

#### I know it might not be the best nor the most efficient way, so feel free to make changes and improve it.

#### (This README will also become more detailed on how to use it when I come closer to what I would consider a "release")
