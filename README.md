## **Simple Game Engine**

### This is not realy a game engine. It's more like the ground work for my friend or other people to start developing simple games.

#### It includes the ability to draw from multiple classes, a KeyListener, MouseListener and more!.

#### I know it might not be the best nor the most efficient way, so feel free to make changes and improve it.
